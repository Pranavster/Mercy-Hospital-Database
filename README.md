# Mercy-Hospital-Database
This is an SQL database that can be accessed in Python. It includes functions for creating connection between SQL and Python, which in turn is used to create a table for patients, reading data into the table from a CSV, updating the table through specified queries and deleting the table. Additionally, a GUI through Tkinter has been created which allows for a more user-friendly interface.
